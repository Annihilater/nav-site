# Nav-Site Rules

- Frontend framework: "/app/(site)" uses Tailwind, "/app/admin" uses Ant Design, please do not use Tailwind in "/app/admin" as much as possible
- Due to compatibility issues between Ant Design 5.0 and React 19, it is necessary to reference compatibility packages in the application entry under /app/admin: import '@ant-design/v5-patch-for-react-19'
